**Maths Quiz** is an interactive website that allows users to challenge their Mathematical ability by answering a range of different Maths questions. The questions include: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The website is mainly targetted at those who are approximately aged 10 and younger, as the questions are basic Maths questions. However, it is recommended for all ages, if anyone would like to improve their Maths skills.

## Features

There are a few features that enhance the user's experience. For example, a countdown timer, updating the user's scores and an option to get their results via email.

### Countdown Timer

- This is located above the game area, to the right.
- This allows the user to see how much time is left for them to answer the questions.
- Enables them to know how long they have spent on the quiz by simply looking above the game area, rather than having to time themselves.

### Updating the user's scores

- Below the game area is a section that counts the number of correct ans incorrect answers they have inputted.
- The number of correct answers is shown in green and the number of incorrect answers is shown in red.
- This tells the user the exact number of correct and incorrect answers and gives them an indication of how they are doing, rather than the user having to keep track of their answers.

### Results sent via email

- Below the seciton for updating the user's scores, there is an option for the user to have their results sent to them via email.
- Allows them to have their results stored safely in their inbox, in case they ever need to refer back to their scores.
- This can help them keep track of numerous attempts at the quiz, without having to remember the score of every game they have played. 

## Testing

The navigation bar on the top right hand corner of the website was tested to ensure each link navigated to the correct section of the website. There were 3 links and each one navigates to a different section of the website. Each link navigates to its section with no problems.

The website was tested for responsiveness for different screen sizes. One problem that occurred was the appearence of the website on the different devices. It did not appear exactly how it was meant to appear.

## Validator Testing

To ensure the HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes ran smoothly and had no errors, they were each tested for validation. Testing for each code and more information on how they were tested are explained below in more detail.

1. HTML
