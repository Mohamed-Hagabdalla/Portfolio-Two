# Maths Quiz

[View the live project here!](https://mohamed-hagabdalla.github.io/Portfolio-Two/)

**Maths Quiz** is a website aimed at those who are interested in improving their fitness by joining a gym. In the first section, the user can find a promotion offer, benefits of joining, a list of equipment offered and opening hours. There is an about us section, which provides the user with more information about what they can expect by joining, accompanied by images of existing members in the gym. The final section is the contact section, in which the user can provide their full name and email address and they will be contacted to discuss any matters further.

## Features

There are a few features that enhance the user's experience. For example, a navigation bar, images, contact form and a footer.

### Navigation Bar

- This is located at the top right hand corner of the page.
- They navigate the user to different sections of the page. For instance, the 'About Us' section and the 'Contact' section.
- Enables them to view different sections on the webpage without having to manually scroll each time.

### Images

- Images have been included to give the user a view of the gym and how training sessions will look.
- Shows them the experience of existing members.

### Contact Form

- This form allows users to provide their contact details to discuss any further enquiries before purchasing a membership.
- Allows them to ensure they are willing to purchase a membership, as they will be contacted.

### Footer

- This contains links to social media sites for **The GYM** that open in a new tab, so the user does not have to go back to the website everytime.
- Encourages the user to keep up to date with the latest news and offers.

## Testing

The navigation bar on the top right hand corner of the website was tested to ensure each link navigated to the correct section of the website. There were 3 links and each one navigates to a different section of the website. Each link navigates to its section with no problems.

The website was tested for responsiveness for different screen sizes. One problem that occurred was the appearence of the website on the different devices. It did not appear exactly how it was meant to appear.

## Validator Testing

To ensure the HTML and CSS codes ran smoothly and had no errors, they were both tested for validation. Testing for each code and more information on how they were tested are explained below in more detail.

1. HTML
-  No errors were found when running the HTML code on the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

2. CSS
- No errors were found when running the CSS code on the [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Unfixed Bugs

One unfixed bug was the responsiveness of the website on different devices using CSS3. The website did not appear exactly how it was intended. This was due to the layout of the website. The website could have had a much better layout, which could have possibly made it easier to make responsive.

## Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub pages. To successfully deploy a website, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure the relevant respository is loaded and select the settings tab.
2. Navigate to the pages tab (the second-last option on the left hand side).
3. Select the main branch, the root folder and click save.
4. Refresh the page and a message should appear, telling you that your site has been published.
5. The website has successfuly been deployed.
